Later, they meet again from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM to review advertising strategies for a new product launch. \nThe Sales team needs to meet from 9:45 AM to 11:00 AM, with another meeting from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM. Their third meeting is from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM to discuss client follow-ups. \nThe HR team has scheduled their meeting from 10:45 AM until 11:30 AM, with a follow-up session from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM to discuss employee engagement. \nThe Product team wants to meet from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM for a product launch review, with another session from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM to finalize the roadmap. \nThe Customer Support team has a meeting from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM and another from 1:15 PM to 2:00 PM to align on support processes for upcoming releases.\n\n\nBased on these meeting times, what's the minimum number of conference rooms we need to book to accommodate all these meetings? Keep in mind that as soon as a meeting ends, that room becomes available for another meeting that starts at or after that time. Can you help figure this out?
