Collect equipment requests (name and quantity) from:\n   - Huang Jie\n   - Sophia Rodriguez\n   - Mike Chen\n   at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home\n\n2.

Despite searching for keywords such as \"equipment request,\" \"request,\" and \"equipment,\" there was no visible or clickable element that provided the relevant details.\n\nThis indicates that either the equipment request information may be housed in a different part of the system that is not immediately accessible from the homepage/channels, or additional permissions or navigation might be needed to locate the data.\n\nThe next steps could involve:\n1. Verifying with other sections of the platform or release notes for a location associated with equipment request management.\n2. Considering whether additional login credentials or settings are required to access this information.\n3. Possibly reaching out (programmatically) to Chen Xinyi for clarifications or alternative instructions if the equipment request information is available elsewhere.\n\nFor now, no equipment request data (names and quantities) for Huang Jie, Sophia Rodriguez, or Mike Chen was found on the website.\n\n                Provide me with the next instruction and input (if needed) based on my response and our current task: <task>Complete the following task:\n1.
