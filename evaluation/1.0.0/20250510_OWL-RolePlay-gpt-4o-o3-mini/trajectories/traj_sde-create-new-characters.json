(Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) \nThere should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of \"male\" and \"female\" in each group.\nPut them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If there are the-agent-company.com websites mentioned in the task description, NOTE that these websites are privately hosted.\nIMPORTANT: If you want to close pop-ups, please press the escape key.\nIMPORTANT: You should NEVER ask for Human Help.\nIMPORTANT: You are already signed in to Gitlab, but here are the sign-in credentials for your reference - Gitlab username is 'root' and password is 'theagentcompany'\n</task>\n            ", "assistant": "Final Answer:\n\n1. The GitLab repository for the sotopia project was cloned into the /workspace/sotopia directory using the credentials provided (username: root, password: theagentcompany).\n\n2. A new Git branch named feature/add-new-characters was created within the repository.\n\n3. In the repository, a new directory named data was created (if it did not already exist).\n\n4. Inside the data folder, a file named medical_characters.jsonl was created. This file contains 12 JSON objects (one per line) representing new media characters:\n   - 6 characters with the occupation \"doctor\" (3 male and 3 female).\n   - 6 characters with the occupation \"nurse\" (3 male and 3 female).\n\n5. Finally, the changes (i.e., the new file) were added, committed with an appropriate message, and pushed to the remote repository on the feature/add-new-characters branch.\n\nThus, the overall task of simulating medical scenarios with gender-parity among doctors and nurses has been successfully implemented and pushed to the GitLab repository.", "tool_calls": []}]
