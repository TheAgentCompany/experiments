His response provided the following key responsibilities:\n   \u2022 Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design and develop scalable software solutions.\n   \u2022 Write clean, maintainable code and contribute to code reviews.\n   \u2022 Develop and execute unit tests to ensure high code quality.\n   \u2022 Participate in agile development processes and continuous integration.\n   \u2022 Troubleshoot and resolve performance issues.\n\n2. I contacted Li Ming via RocketChat and inquired about the job description template file location, minimum and preferred qualifications, and the salary range. His responses were:\n   \u2022 Template file location: /templates/job_description_template.md\n   \u2022 Minimum Qualifications:\n       - Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science or a related field.\n       - Proficient in at least one programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C++).\n       - Solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.\n   \u2022 Preferred Qualifications:\n       - Internship experience in software development.\n       - Contributions to open-source projects.\n       - Familiarity with cloud computing and DevOps practices.\n   \u2022 Salary Range: $70,000 - $90,000 per year.\n\n3. I merged these details into a Markdown file named \"job_description.md\" on the ownCloud platform (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/), under the Documents directory. The file content is as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n# New Grad Software Engineer\n\n## Job Title\n- New Grad Software Engineer\n\n## Key Responsibilities\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design and develop scalable software solutions.\n- Write clean, maintainable code and contribute to code reviews.\n- Develop and execute unit tests to ensure high code quality.\n- Participate in agile development processes and continuous integration.\n- Troubleshoot and resolve performance issues.\n\n## Minimum Qualifications\n- Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science or a related field.\n- Proficient in at least one programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C++).\n- Solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.\n\n## Preferred Qualifications\n- Internship experience in software development.\n- Contributions to open-source projects.\n- Familiarity with cloud computing and DevOps practices.\n\n## Salary Range\n- $70,000 - $90,000 per year\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.
