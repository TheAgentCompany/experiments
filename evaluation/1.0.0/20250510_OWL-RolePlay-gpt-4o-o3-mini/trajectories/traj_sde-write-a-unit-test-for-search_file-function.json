We located the search_file function in the file /workspace/openhands/openhands/runtime/plugins/agent_skills/file_ops/file_ops.py. The function searches for a given term in a specified file (or the current open file) and prints out any matching lines along with their line numbers.\n\n4. We wrote a unit test named test_search_file in the file /workspace/openhands/tests/unit/test_agent_skill.py. This unit test covers various scenarios:\n   \u2022 Searching for a term present in a file to ensure that matches are correctly identified.\n   \u2022 Searching for a term not present in the file to confirm the correct \u201cno matches\u201d message.\n   \u2022 Handling non-existent files by verifying the appropriate error message.\n   \u2022 Checking behavior when no file is specified by ensuring the global CURRENT_FILE is not set.\n\n5. Finally, we ran the unit test. The test output indicated that all test cases passed, confirming that the search_file function behaves as expected under all tested conditions.\n\nThis completes the task as originally described.", "tool_calls": []}]
