Open a terminal and navigate to the JanusGraph repository directory:\n   cd /workspace/janusgraph\n\n2. Review the server configuration file. Typically, JanusGraph uses Gremlin Server; check for files like:\n   - conf/gremlin-server/gremlin-server.yaml \n   - or, if available, conf/gremlin-server/janusgraph-server.yaml\n\n   Open the configuration file and verify (or update) that the network settings are set to use port 8182. For example, in the YAML file you might see:\n   \n      host: 0.0.0.0\n      port: 8182\n\n   Also, ensure that the HTTP endpoint settings are enabled. In many cases, JanusGraph\u2019s Gremlin Server configuration provides a WebSocket port for the Gremlin endpoint. To enable an HTTP endpoint, you may need to add or modify the protocols section. For example, you might add something like:\n   \n      protocols:\n        - org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.protocol.HttpChannelizer\n      \n   (Note: The exact configuration may vary based on your JanusGraph version and documentation\u2014check the provided docs or conf file headers for guidance.)\n\n3. Once the configuration file is updated with the proper port (8182) and the HTTP protocol enabled, start the server by executing the server script. Typically, if Maven was used to build JanusGraph, the distribution includes a script to start the server. Run:\n   \n   ./bin/gremlin-server.sh conf/gremlin-server/gremlin-server.yaml\n\n   (If the build produces a different startup script, check the documentation in the repository for the exact command. It may also be named something like janusgraph.sh.)\n\n4. Monitor the terminal output. The server should now start and display logs confirming that it\u2019s running and listening on port 8182 with the HTTP endpoint enabled.\n\nFollowing these steps will launch the JanusGraph server with the desired configuration.
