First, clear any blocking pop-ups (like the \"Explore The New 24.04.9.2\" message from Collabora Online) by simulating pressing Escape or clicking on a blank area until they disappear.\n\n2. Confirm that the ownCloud user interface is in list view. This is important because list view shows the file names along with download icons. If the portal is in gallery view or document editor mode (which might happen when a file is opened), switch to list view so that you can see and interact with all files in the folder.\n\n3.

Within the Financials folder, locate the file named \"budget.xlsx\".
