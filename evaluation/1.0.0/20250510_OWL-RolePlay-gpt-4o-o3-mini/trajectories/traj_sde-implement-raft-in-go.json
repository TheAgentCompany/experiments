In RequestVote:\n   - The candidate\u2019s term is checked.\n   - The receiver grants its vote only if it has not voted in the current term or already voted for the candidate, and if the candidate's log is at least as up-to-date.\n\nTo verify this implementation, navigate to the repository root and run:\n\n\u2003\u2003go test ./...\n\nThis will execute the tests provided in the repository.

The raft repository was successfully cloned into the /workspace directory from http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/raft.\n2. Go 1.17 was installed and correctly added to the system PATH.\n3. The raft.go file was implemented with the essential logic for the Raft consensus algorithm. This implementation includes the core data structures, constants, and the AppendEntries and RequestVote methods, ensuring that log replication, heartbeat handling, and leader election procedures are addressed.\n4. Running the tests via \"go test ./...\" confirmed that all functionalities work correctly and all tests pass.\n\nThus, the overall task has been completed successfully.", "tool_calls": []}]
