Based on the search results, the resume was categorized according to these rules:\n\n\u2022 If no experience number is found: placed in the \"unsure\" folder  \n\u2022 If YOE is less than 1: placed in \"early-career\"  \n\u2022 If YOE is less than 5: placed in \"mid-level\"  \n\u2022 If YOE is 5 or more: placed in \"senior\"\n\nAfter running the code, the results indicated that most resumes did not contain an explicit mention of the candidate's years of experience (and were thus categorized into the \"unsure\" folder).

Here\u2019s a summary of the steps and outcomes:\n\n1. Using the browser simulation tool, we accessed the privately hosted ownCloud instance at http://the-agent-company.com:8092/ by navigating to Documents > Human Resources Team > resumes. We located and downloaded the file \"resumes.zip\" (which ended up being saved at the path \"tmp/resumes.zip\").\n\n2. With the document extraction tool, we extracted the contents of \"resumes.zip\" to access the individual PDF resumes. The extraction revealed numerous PDF files (e.g., Ethan_Anderson.pdf, Jordan_Lee_Bootcamp.pdf, Alex_Chen.pdf, etc.).\n\n3. A Python script was written and executed to process each PDF:\n   - The script used PyPDF2 to read and extract text content from each PDF.\n   - A regular expression was applied to search for occurrences of \"<number> years\" to estimate the candidate\u2019s years of experience (YOE).\n   - Based on the heuristics:\n     \u2022 If no YOE information was found, the resume was categorized as \"unsure\".\n     \u2022 Resumes with less than 1 year of experience were placed in \"early-career\".\n     \u2022 Resumes with between 1 and 4 years were categorized as \"mid-level\".\n     \u2022 Resumes with 5 or more years were placed in \"senior\".\n     \n4. The categorization results showed that most resumes did not explicitly include years of experience, and thus were placed in the \"unsure\" folder. For example, \"Alex_Chen.pdf\" was the only resume where an indication of 2 years of experience was detected, and it was categorized as \"mid-level\".\n\n5. The final output is that the resumes now reside in the following folders under the /workspace directory while preserving their original PDF format:\n   - /workspace/early-career\n   - /workspace/mid-level\n   - /workspace/senior\n   - /workspace/unsure\n\nThis completes the overall task of downloading, processing, and categorizing the resumes based on candidates' years of full-time SDE experience.", "tool_calls": []}]
