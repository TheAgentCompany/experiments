The file agenthub/micro/math_agent/agent.yaml was located inside the cloned repository.\n\n3. The file was modified as required:\n\u2003\u2022 On Line 20 (which originally contained \"answer: \\\"Saturday\\\"\"), it was changed to \"Thursday\".\n\u2003\u2022 On Line 24 (which originally contained \"answer: \\\"0.603848\\\"\"), it was updated to \"0.620537\".\n\n4. The changes were verified by extracting the file content, ensuring that the 3rd example\u2019s output now shows:\n\u2003\u2003- For the question \"What day of the week is 2099-01-01?\", the output is \"Thursday\".\n\u2003\u2003- And for the integral problem example, the output is \"0.620537\".\n\nThese steps complete the overall task.", "tool_calls": []}]
