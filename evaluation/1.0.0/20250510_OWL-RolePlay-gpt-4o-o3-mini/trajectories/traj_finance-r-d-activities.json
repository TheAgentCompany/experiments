To support this application, complete the following documentation:\n\n- According to /Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt, reach out to relevant personell via RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home, asking about the time spent on R&D related activities and the nature of the work.\n- Review responses, and check if they are qualified activities according to /Documents/Financials/Qualified_R&D_Activities.md.\n- For activities that qualify for the R&D tax credit, create a new csv file on ownCloud and record the following columns in /Documents/Financials/Research_Time_Tracking_Records.csv:\n    - Employee \n    - Hours_spent\n    - Qualified_R&D_activities\n- Using /Documents/Financials/TAC_salary.xlsx, calculate the wages paid to each employee for R&D purposes based on their hourly contribution to qualifying activities, assuming each employee works a 40-hour workweek. Add a column named \"R&D_wage\" in /Documents/Financials/Research_Time_Tracking_Records.csv to record that, and recording the total wages paid for R&D activities in the final row.\n\nIMPORTANT: If there are the-agent-company.com websites mentioned in the task description, NOTE that these websites are privately hosted.\nIMPORTANT: If you want to close pop-ups, please press the escape key.\nIMPORTANT: You should NEVER ask for Human Help.\n</task>\n                Before producing the final answer, please check whether I have rechecked the final answer using different toolkit as much as possible.
