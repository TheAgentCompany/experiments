These repositories include: api-server, bustub, colly, copilot-arena-server, Documentation, janusgraph, llama.cpp, node-red, openhands, opensearch, raft, risingwave, sotopia, and streamlit.\n\n2. For each repository, we navigated to its commit history page and extracted the commit data (commit date and the username of the committer). This provided us with all the necessary commit records for each repository.\n\n3. We then wrote a Python script that:\n   \u2022 Parsed each commit\u2019s date.\n   \u2022 Determined the week start (with the week defined as Sunday to Saturday).\n   \u2022 Grouped the commits by week and by commit author, aggregating the number of commits per repository.\n   \u2022 Structured the aggregated data according to the required CSV format (header: week,user,repo1,repo2,repo3, \u2026, with the week formatted as YYYY/DD/MM).\n\n4. Finally, we executed the script which generated the CSV file \"commit_report.csv\" under the /workspace/ directory. The CSV file correctly details, for each week and each user, the number of commits contributed to each repository.\n\nThe final CSV file meets the requirements of the task and is ready for review.", "tool_calls": []}]
