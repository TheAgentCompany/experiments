The company needs to ensure that recognized revenue matches contract values over their respective terms. Some contracts may have recognition schedules that don't align with their total values. If there is a discrepancy then contact the employee through Rocketchat http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home\n\nNavigate to Documents/Human Resources Team/Contracts on Owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/) and find the following files:\n1. `contracts.xlsx`\n2. `revenue_schedule.xlsx`\n\nFor each contract, sum up all revenue recognition entries\n- Compare total recognized revenue against the contract value\n- Identify contracts where:\n   - Total recognized revenue doesn't match contract value (within a small tolerance)\n   - Recognition schedule doesn't align with contract term\n- Account for contracts with different terms and payment schedules\n\nCreate `flagged_contracts.xlsx` saved in the /workspace folder with column 'Flagged_Contracts' which has Contract IDs with recognition discrepancies.\n\nTo contact the employees with flagged contracts, use the employee_contracts.xlsx file to find which employees have flagged contracts.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If there are the-agent-company.com websites mentioned in the task description, NOTE that these websites are privately hosted.\nIMPORTANT: If you want to close pop-ups, please press the escape key.\nIMPORTANT: You should NEVER ask for Human Help.\n</task>\n                Before producing the final answer, please check whether I have rechecked the final answer using different toolkit as much as possible.
